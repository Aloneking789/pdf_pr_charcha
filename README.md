# Pdf_pe_Charcha Project

The **Pdf_pe_Charcha** project facilitates interactive discussions and information retrieval from PDF documents using natural language queries. Built on **Streamlit** and integrated with **language processing** and **retrieval tools**, this application allows users to:

- Upload PDF files
- Extract text
- Split text into manageable chunks
- Store text in a **vectorized format** for efficient querying

## Key Features

- **Streamlit Integration**: Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and interacting with PDF documents.
- **Language Processing Tools**: Utilized to process and understand natural language queries.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Text is stored in a vectorized format, enabling quick and accurate information retrieval.
- **Interactive Discussions**: Facilitates meaningful and interactive discussions based on the content of the uploaded PDF documents.

## Workflow

1. **Upload PDF Files**: Users can upload PDF documents through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Extract Text**: The application extracts text from the uploaded PDF.
3. **Text Chunking**: Extracted text is split into manageable chunks.
4. **Vectorization**: Text chunks are stored in a vectorized format for efficient querying.
5. **Querying**: Users can make natural language queries to retrieve relevant information from the PDF content.

This combination of **Streamlit**, **language processing**, and **retrieval tools** makes **Pdf_pe_Charcha** a powerful tool for extracting and interacting with information in PDF documents.
